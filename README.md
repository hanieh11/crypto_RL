# CryptoRL: Reinforcement Learning for Cryptocurrency Trading 

CryptoRL is an open-source project that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create intelligent agents for automated cryptocurrency trading. The repository provides a modular framework designed to train, test, and evaluate RL algorithms on historical cryptocurrency data, with support for multiple assets, technical indicators, and customizable environments.

**finrl-crypto notebook**:

This notebook demonstrates how to use the FinRL framework to train reinforcement learning agents for cryptocurrency trading. Instead of using the custom CryptoEnv (which had unresolved dependency issues), it leverages FinRLâ€™s streamlined stock trading environment and adapts it for crypto markets.
Key Features:
- Train Various RL Agents: Implement popular algorithms like PPO, DDPG, and A2C on cryptocurrency data using FinRL.
- Simplified Setup: Avoids complex environment setups by using FinRL's well-maintained framework.
- Guided by YouTube Tutorial: Written with the help of [eminshall youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNERM8mbcsQ&t=598s) and [FinRL tutorials](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Tutorials), making it easy to follow and replicate.

This notebook is a quick and practical way to explore RL-based crypto trading without dealing with complex dependencies!
